This is a tool to execute jobs on a remote Linux server.
User needs to specify their shell commands in a script(remote.sh) and run 
example.py. All the outputs will be generated in the same directory under the 
folder output.

The main idea is to fork a child process to run ssh. Connect the child's 
controlling terminal to a pty so that parent process can write to and read from 
it. Use regular expression to match the possible prompt from child process, 
like "password:" or "the authentication of xxx cannot be established" and do 
stuff accordingly.

What can be done better?
Right now, the code doesn't maintain a ssh session with server. Every time a 
command is run, a new ssh connection is setup. Should be able to improve.
